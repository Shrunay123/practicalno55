<h1> NATIONAL INDIAN CRICKET TEAM</h1>
<img src="cricket.jpg"alt="Image">
<p>
    The Indian cricket team is one of the most successful cricket teams in the world,
         having won 2 ICC World Cups, 1 ICC World Twenty20, 2 ICC Champion's Trophies and finished runners up in the inaugural
        edition of the ICC World Test Championship. The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, was initially meant to be hosted by India.
         Cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by British sailors in the 18th century, 
         and the first cricket club was established in 1792. 
     India's men's national cricket team played its first international match on 25 June 1932 in a 
        Lord's Test against England becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. India had to wait until 1952,
        almost twenty years, for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, success was limited,
        with only 35 wins in 196 Tests.[12] The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players like Sunil Gavaskar,
        Gundappa Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.
